        <h6>12 Days of Christmas Greater Green Island Community treasure Hunt 10th 21st December</h6>
        <p class="lead">Between 10th and 21st December GGICN will hide 13 letters in 12 locations around the Greater Green Island community.
          Each day a clue will be revealed to lead you to a new location, with different letters. When the letters are unscrambled, the letters will create a secret Christmas phrase.
          Your job: Solve the clues, photograph the hidden letters, get the prize!
          Send your photos through to 12days@greatergreenisland.nz or message the GGICN Facebook page.
          Missed a day? No worries! Letters will remain in place the duration of the event so you can go back to earlier locations to hunt down the letters.
          Clues will be released in three places:
        <ul>
          <li> Greater Green Island Facebook page </li>
          <li>Instagram @ggicn12days </li>

        </ul>
        The the three ways to win include:
        <ul>
          <li> 1. Be the first person to email or Facebook message us a photo of the letter at the most recently revealed location. </li>
